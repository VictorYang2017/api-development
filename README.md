# API Development
A project to introduce how to build an API.

## Setup
First, clone or fork the project :)

## Branches
The master branch (this branch) only contains this README.md file which acts as a contents page for the other branches.
Each branch is a different project related to the subject of API development

### [data-persistence: Data persistence with MongoDB and Mongoose](https://github.com/richjava/api-development/tree/data-persistence)

This branch is an example API project including routes and models with simple CRUD functionality. Data is persisted to a 
MongoDB database hosted on mLab. Mongoose is used for object data modelling. There is just one entity: Articles.

A working example of this is available on Glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/api-data-persistence?path=README.md:64:199)

### [relationships: Implementing relationships between entities](https://github.com/richjava/api-development/tree/relationships)

This branch is an example API project to demonstrate how to implement relationships between entities in an API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.

There are two entities:

* Articles
* Users

A working example of this is available on Glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/api-entity-relationships?path=README.md:49:46)
